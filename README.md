2019-Robot

**This codebase is deprecated, and should not be used for anything but reference purposes.**
You probably want [2019-Robot-B3](https://github.com/frc868/2019-Robot-B3) instead.
Among other things, 2019-Robot-B3 follows our [coding standards](https://wiki.techhounds.com/posts/2019-11-12-coding-standards.html), and uses `TimedRobot` over command-based programming.
